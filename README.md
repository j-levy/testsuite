# testsuite

TestSuite (or testsuite or whatever you might want to write it) will be a shell dedicated to testing programs.

It will be a school project as an exercise of what the course of System Programming taught us.

And it will be A LOT OF FUN YAAAAY 

# Language

This project will be written in C++.

## Why C++ ?

Because we never programmed in C++ and our teacher wanted us to do some Object-Oriented Programming with a C background.
